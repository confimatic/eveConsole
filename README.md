CONSOLE SERVER EMULATOR FOR EVE-NG

This script will look for the TCP port allocated to the running EVE-NG devices, and then build a menu driven connection the the console port by telnet to the TCP port.

This one is mainly for EVE-NG professional as this one doesn't show the TCP ports as easy as the Community version.
